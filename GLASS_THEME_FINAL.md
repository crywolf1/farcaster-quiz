- ❌ Static background

#### After (TRUE GLASSY!)
- ✅ **VIBRANT animated gradient background**: Purple → Pink → Blue (shifts smoothly!)
- ✅ **WHITE TEXT with drop-shadow**: All text is now bright white with beautiful shadows
- ✅ **SUPER TRANSPARENT cards**: bg-white/10 and bg-white/15 (barely there!)
- ✅ **STRONGER BLUR**: backdrop-blur-3xl (maximum frosted glass effect)
- ✅ **THICKER BORDERS**: border-2 with white/30 and white/40 (more visible!)
